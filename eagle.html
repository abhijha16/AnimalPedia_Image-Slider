            Eagles, majestic birds of prey, are renowned for their grace, power, and keen senses. Belonging to the family Accipitridae, they are characterized by their strong, hooked beaks, sharp talons, and exceptional vision. With wingspans reaching over 7 feet, eagles are formidable hunters, adept at catching fish, small mammals, and other birds.

            Distributed across diverse habitats worldwide, eagles are found on every continent except Antarctica. Their habitats range from dense forests and rugged mountains to coastal cliffs and open plains. Notable species include the Bald Eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States, and the Golden Eagle, revered in many cultures for its strength and beauty.

            Eagles play significant roles in various ecosystems, regulating populations of prey species and serving as indicators of environmental health. However, they face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and illegal hunting. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring the survival of these iconic birds for future generations.
