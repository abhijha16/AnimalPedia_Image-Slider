                        The Alaska moose, also known as the Yukon moose, is a symbol of rugged wilderness and majestic beauty. These giants of the northern forests are the largest members of the deer family, with males (bulls) often towering over 7 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 1,500 pounds.
